# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
#
#     List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#     Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#     Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#     Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

# set starts with {}
# sets are collection of unique values
# sets are unidexed and unordered

# lets create a set

my_set = {22,11,44,23}
print("my_set",my_set)

# set is not in sequence, it uses hash

# set doesnot allow duplicate values
my_set1={22,44,55,22,87}
# it will print 22 at once only
print("my_set1",my_set1)
